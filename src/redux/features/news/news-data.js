Thomas Mbomba, MP, has underscored the importance of the International Organisation of La Francophonie (OIF) in the promotion of peace, democracy, economic cooperation among other things, over the past 52 years. He made the remark during a Flag-raising ceremony to commemorate the 52nd Anniversary of the OIF, on 18th March, 2022, which took place at the forecourt of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration. He announced that Ghana’s intention of becoming a full member of the OIF had enabled it to put in place several measures to that effect.",
            "According to Hon. Mbomba, Ghana has received twenty-one (21) experts since the beginning of the year from OIF member countries who have volunteered to provide training for French teachers in Colleges of Education, Regional Centers for Teaching of French (CREF), and bilingual schools. He acknowledged that as one of several benefits that the country could derive from its association with the Organisation, as it endeavours to become a bilingual State. He added that the Flag Raising ceremony was a demonstration of the country’s commitment to the Organisation.",
            "On his part, H.E. Mr. Maher Kheir, the Lebanese Ambassador to Ghana and the President of La Francophonie Ambassadors’ Group, in his address noted that the Flag Raising ceremony was historic, as it was the first time Ghana was marking the anniversary of OIF with a special event. He commended Ghana’s effort towards becoming a bilingual country.",
